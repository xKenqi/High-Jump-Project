# High-Jump-Project
Jumping starts at the height of 10 and is increased by increments of 2. At each
height you can decide, on your turn, if you try to jump the height or if you skip it. If
you go for that height, you have three jumps in which to master it. Take all three
attempts before the next player takes his turn. On each jump you throw all five dice.
The jump is successful if the total of all dice equals or exceeds the current height.
If you have three invalid attempts at one height you have to stop.
Scoring: The maximum height which was successfully mastered.
